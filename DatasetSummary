# Dataset Summary
The dataset we are analyzing with this climate change project is the Data on CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Our World in Data.
This data was collected from a multitude of sources including the Global Carbon project, Climate Watch portal, the BP statistical review of World Energy, and many World Bank or World Development Indicators.
The data was provided to create a complete and robust amalgamation of Greenhouse gas and co2 metrics for each country, continent, and other categories such as high income countries.
Authors of this dataset, Hannah Ritchie, Max Roser, Edouard Mathieu, Bobbie Macdonald and Pablo Rosado, set out to create a comprehensive but readable and easily accessible climate change dataset.
They wanted this dataset to include every country and several forms of co2 analysis such as per capita, per GDP, concrete co2, and many others.
This dataset has 61 columns and 25989 rows all of which provide valuable and legible data on the subject of climate change over time.
Data was retrieved from independent investigations and from governmental sources.
Some possible limitations of the data include the measuring of co2 emissions per country as co2 emissions are difficult to measure even with proper documentation.
Especially in countries with unstable governments, measuring co2 emissions is not a top priority and therefore these figures may be educated guesses at best.
Governments did not treat climate change with care until recently, and with this data going as far back as the 1750s, documentation may be incredibly inaccurate.

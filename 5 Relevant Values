# 5 Relevant Values of Interest
First relevant value was the country with the highest co2 emissions per capita in 2020 (the most recent year of the study).
This country ended up being Qatar, with total output of 106.655 co2 and 37.019 co2 per capita.
The second relevant value was conversely the lowest co2 emissions per capita in 2020.
This title is given to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with co2 of 2.477 and a co2 per capita of 0.028.
Our third relevant value was the highest co2 emissions per GDP in 1970. This country was Libya with emissions of 32.305, 15.142 per capita, and co2 per GDP of 2.452.
The fourth relevant value is a table of the highest co2 emissions per capita in the last 50 years, 1970 - 2020.
This table is incredibly interesting as it shows countries such as Qatar and the U.A.E but also countries such as the tiny island nation of Sint Maarten, and Curacao.
Qatar is the overwhelming majority though having held the record every year except three from 1991-2020, those three years going to Curacao.
The maximum co2_per_capita ranges from  233.182 in 1970 to 29.56 in 1988. But overall the 1970s hold 8 out of the top 10 spots for most co2_per_capita.
But the top 10 lowest spots are split between the 1980s and 2010s, with the most recent year 2020 coming in at 11th.
Our Fifth and final relevant value is a graph of Sint Maarten co2_per_capita emissions since 1950.
The Sint Maarten plot begins absurdly high around 750 co2_per_capita but after the 1960s plummets to 10-20 throughout the 1970s, 80s, 90s, and 2000s.
They held the spot for highest co2_per_capita in the world every year from 1970 to 1984 the longest such streak since the 1970s.
While there are no definitive articles on how Sint Maarten has reduced its co2 emissions so drastically, Sint Maarten was positioned to be devastated by rising sea levels and increased hurricane activity.
The Dutch government of Sint Maarten has pledged to reduce co2 emissions by 20% within the next decade, on top of the progress they have already made.
Sint Maarten may provide valuable insights to a roadmap that other countries can follow to reduce carbon emissions.
